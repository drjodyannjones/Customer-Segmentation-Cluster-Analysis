# Customer Segmentation Model

In this project, I built a kmeans alorithm utilizing n_clusters = 4 as the most optimal parameters to choose. We choose the value for this parameter by visualizaing the elbow method, where the dip in the graph(or elbow) shows the ideal number of clusters that the model should assign in its parameters. After analyzing these clusters some more, I observed that the customer segments can be labled: {0:'well-off', 
                                                    1:'fewer-opportunities',
                                                    2: 'standard',
                                                    3: 'career focused'}
                                                    
This information would prove helpful to the store's key decision-makers when exploring marketing/advertising options. Using the insights generated from this model, the key decison makers would be able to tailor purchasing options for each cluster.The improvement in recommendations for product subscriptions and suggestions for new purchases based on the user's historical buying patterns will only add value to the company's overall strategy for increasing custmer engagement, improving product awarenes, and increasing sales.
