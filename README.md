# Customer Segmentation Model


I built a kmeans alorithm utilizing n_clusters = 4 as the most optimal parameters to choose. We choose the value for this parameter by visualizaing the elbow method, where the dip in the graph(or elbow) shows the ideal number of clusters that the model should assign in its parameters. After analyzing these clusters some more, I observed that the customer segments can be labled: {0:'well-off', 
                                                    1:'fewer-opportunities',
                                                    2: 'standard',
                                                    3: 'career focused'}
